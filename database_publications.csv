Since the characteristics of the seismically-induced pressure perturbations are connected to their seismic counterparts, they provide a unique opportunity to investigate the atmospheric and interior structures of a planet or to constrain source properties. However, in Earth’s remote regions, deploying seismic or infrasound networks at the surface can be a difficult task. Stratospheric balloon platforms equipped with pressure sensors have therefore gained interest since they provide a unique and inexpensive way to record pressure signals in the atmosphere with a low noise level. Yet, infrasound observations of Earthquakes on balloon platforms have never been reported in the literature.

The first 12 events (May 17 - May 26) are associated with the explosive eruptions and the remaining 50 events (May 29 - August 02) onwards are accompanied by large-scale caldera collapses. It is challenging to resolve their locations and mechanisms because of the shallow source depths, complex velocity structure, and significant non double-couple components. We show the necessity to combine multiple geophysical data including broadband seismometers, accelerometers and infrasound sensors to resolve different aspects of the seismic source. The seismic moment tensor solutions using near-field summit stations show the early events are highly isotropic. Infrasound data and particle motion analysis identify the Halema’uma’u reservoir as …|https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10506637.1|INFLATION AND ASYMMETRIC COLLAPSE AT KILAUEA SUMMIT DURING THE 2018 ERUPTION FROM SEISMIC AND INFRASOUND ANALYSES

This is particularly valuable above 30 km altitude where few other currently available technologies provide direct measurements, especially for the dynamics. In the current work, we update ensemble-averaged ERA5 atmospheric models to become consistent with sets of infrasound array observations of travel-time, backazimuth, and apparent velocity.

Ionospheric measurements of Co-Seismic Disturbances (CIDs) offer a unique solution to characterize an earthquake's tsunami potential in Near-Real-Time (NRT) since CIDs can be detected within 15min of a seismic event. However, the detection of CIDs rely on human experts which currently prevents the deployment of ionospheric methods in NRT. To address this critical lack of automatic procedure, we train machine-learning models (random forests) over an extensive ionospheric waveform dataset to (1) classify ionospheric waveforms between CIDs and noise, (2) pick arrival times, and (3) associate arrivals across a satellite network in NRT.

Earth, Moon, and Mars have all hosted seismic instruments on the surface, which have mapped seismic activity and provided insight into their interior. On Venus, high surface temperature and pressure present a difficult technological challenge to traditional seismology. In recent years, balloon-based seismology through the study of low-frequency seismo-acoustic signals (infrasound) has gained acceptance as a viable way to study seismic activity on Venus. Balloon-based barometers have the potential to detect and characterize atmospheric waves launched by venusquakes and volcanic eruptions while offering substantially longer instrument lifetimes in the Venus middle atmosphere, where temperature and pressure are significantly more benign (-10-100 C) as compared to the surface (> 460 C).

Such basin or site amplification effects have been well documented in numerous regions, yet the complex and often situational dependence of competing reasons for this amplification makes it hard to quantify in a general sense or to determine the most significant contributions. Simple 1D seismic profiles can be used to estimate the amplitude differences between a basin site and a hard‐rock reference site, but this ignores any reflections or conversions at the basin edge or a resonance effect depending on the basin’s geometry. In this article, we explore an analytic model based on coupling coefficients for surface Rayleigh waves to account for the lateral discontinuities at a basin’s edge .

To characterize basin effects, seismologists have routinely employed physic-based regression models to connect observations to the known driving factors of amplification (velocity contrasts, sediment-to-rock depth). However, the surface-wave contribution is commonly neglected and the basin parameters driving amplification are sometimes poorly constrained (lack of high-resolution velocity and density models) or not understood because of the insufficient number of high-quality observations.

Based on those approximations, simple empirical scalings exist to derive phase velocities and amplitudes for pure power-law velocity structures providing an exact relationship between the velocity model and the Green’s functions.

Yet to characterize seismic hazards at a specific site, it is common practice to consider only the effects of near-surface geology on vertically propagating body waves despite surface waves often causing strong damage. Recently, Bowden & Tsai (2017) proposed an semi-analytical method to predict surface-wave basin amplification and noticed that certain large regional earthquake ground motions are under-predicted if surface waves are not properly accounted for. Since the theory is based on a 1-D approximation of the near-surface geologic structure and does not account for path effects, it is of interest to know how significantly such additional complexity affects the 1-D predictions.

This study presents a finite-difference modeling tool tailored for acoustic-gravity wave applications that takes into account the effect of background winds, attenuation phenomena (including relaxation effects specific to carbon dioxide atmospheres) and wave amplification by exponential density decrease with height. The simulation tool is implemented in 2D Cartesian coordinates and first validated by comparison with analytical solutions for benchmark problems. It is then applied to surface explosions simulating meteor impacts on Mars in various Martian atmospheric conditions inferred from global climate models. The acoustic wave travel times are validated by comparison with 2D ray tracing in a windy atmosphere. Our simulations predict that acoustic waves …|https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-016-0324-6|FINITE-DIFFERENCE MODELING OF ACOUSTIC AND GRAVITY WAVE PROPAGATION IN MARS ATMOSPHERE: APPLICATION TO INFRASOUNDS EMITTED BY METEOR IMPACTS

It is a hybrid method between a continuous Galerkin and a discontinuous Galerkin method that accounts for non-linear atmospheric waves, visco-elastic waves and topography. We apply this method to a recent experiment that took place in the Nevada desert to study acoustic waves from seismic events. This experiment, developed by JPL and its partners, wants to demonstrate the viability of a new approach to probe seismic-induced acoustic waves from a balloon platform. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the only way, for planetary missions, to perform tomography when one faces challenging surface conditions, with high pressure and temperature (eg Venus), and thus when it is impossible to use conventional electronics routinely employed on Earth.

To get a better understanding of the physics behind these dynamic processes, both acoustic and gravity waves propagation should be modelled in a 3-D attenuating and windy atmosphere extending from the ground to the upper thermosphere. Thus, in order to provide an efficient numerical tool at the regional or global scale, we introduce a finite difference in the time domain (FDTD) approach that relies on the linearized compressible Navier–Stokes equations with a background flow (wind). One significant benefit of such a method is its versatility because it handles both acoustic and gravity waves in the same simulation, which enables one to observe interactions between them.

Thus an accurate numerical modeling of the solid-fluid coupling and the atmosphere dynamics is thus important to properly understand the coupled solid-fluid system. We therefore introduce a numerical modeling tool that takes into account the propagation of both acoustic and gravity waves in a non-linear atmosphere (Navier-stokes equations) coupled to a linear viscoelastic solid Earth. The implementation is performed based on both discontinuous and continuous Galerkin methods and implemented in the SPECFEM 2D software package.

Radar images have revealed a surface that is much younger than those of the Moon, Mercury, and Mars as well as a variety of enigmatic volcanic and tectonic features quite unlike those we are familiar with on Earth. What are the dynamic processes that shape these features, in the absence of any plate tectonics? What is their relationship with the dense Venus atmosphere, which envelops Venus like an ocean? To understand how Venus works as a planet, we now need to probe its interior. Conventional seismology for probing the interior of a planet employs extremely sensitive motion or speed detectors in contact with the planetary surface. For Venus, these sensors must be deployed on the surface and must tolerate the Venus environment (460 degrees  C and 90 bars) for up to a year. The dense atmosphere of Venus, which efficiently couples seismic energy into the atmosphere as infrasonic waves, enables two alternatives: detection of these infrasonic waves in the middle atmosphere using a string of two or more microbarometers suspended from a floating platform or detection with an orbiting spacecraft of electromagnetic signatures produced by interactions of infrasonic waves in the Venus upper atmosphere and ionosphere. This report, describing the findings of a workshop, sponsored by the Keck Institute of Space Studies (KISS), concludes that seismic investigations can be successful conducted from all three vantage points—surface, middle atmosphere, and space. Separately or, better still, together, these …|https://authors.library.caltech.edu/59019/|PROBING THE INTERIOR STRUCTURE OF VENUS

The details of the code and its validation for Earth atmosphere are presented in session SA003. The simulations include the modeling of both acoustic and gravity waves in the same run, an effects of exponential density decrease, winds and attenuation. The application to Mars requires the inclusion of a specific attenuation effect related to the relaxation induced by vibrational modes of carbon dioxide molecules. Two different applications are presented demonstrating the ability of the simulation tool to work at very different scale length and frequencies. First the propagation of acoustic and gravity waves due to a bolide explosion in the atmosphere of Mars are simulated. This case has a direct application to the atmospheric pressure and seismic measurements that will be performed by …|https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.P23B2148G/abstract|FINITE DIFFERENCE SIMULATIONS OF ACOUSTIC AND GRAVITY WAVE PROPAGATION IN MARS ATMOSPHERE: APPLICATIONS TO INSIGHT NASA MISSION AND MARS MICROPHONE EXPERIMENTS
conference|Numerical modeling of acoustic and gravity waves propagation in the atmosphere using a spectral element method|2015|Roland Martin and Quentin Brissaud and Raphael Garcia and Dimitri Komatitsch|N/A|N/A|6147|EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts|N/A|During low-frequency events such as tsunamis, acoustic and gravity waves are generated and quickly propagate in the atmosphere. Due to the exponential decrease of the atmospheric density with the altitude, the conservation of the kinetic energy imposes that the amplitude of those waves increases (to the order of 105 at 200km of altitude), which allows their detection in the upper atmosphere. This propagation bas been modelled for years with different tools, such as normal modes modeling or to a greater extent time-reversal techniques, but a low-frequency multi-dimensional atmospheric wave modelling is still crucially needed. A modeling tool is worth of interest since there are many different sources, as earthquakes or atmospheric explosions, able to propagate acoustic and gravity waves. In order to provide a fine modeling of the precise observations of these waves by GOCE satellite data, we developed a new …|https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.6147M/abstract|NUMERICAL MODELING OF ACOUSTIC AND GRAVITY WAVES PROPAGATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE USING A SPECTRAL ELEMENT METHOD

Recently, two new observations methods have proven their efficiency: perturbations of airglow emissions and variations of the drag of very low Earth orbit satellites. The perturbations of these observables are mainly due to air density variations induced by post-seismic infrasounds or atmospheric gravity waves generated by tsunamis. Even if the airglow emissions present the great advantage of providing an imaging capability, the weakness of the airglow signal induces long integration time, and does not allow to infer high frequency infrasound signals. Moreover, restrictions on observation conditions and line of sight integration reduce the capability of detailed imaging of atmospheric wavefronts. On the other hand, variations of the satellite drag …|https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFMNH33C..03G/abstract|WHAT CAN WE DO WITH AN ATMOSPHERIC SEISMOMETER MOVING AT 8 KM/S?
