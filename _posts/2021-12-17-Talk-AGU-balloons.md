I will be giving an invited talk at the AGU 2021 during the session S51A - Geophysical and Planetary Seismoacoustics: Capturing the Full Wavefield <https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/801898>. I will be discussing infrasound-based subsurface inversions and offer perspectives for the deployement/design of inversion methods.
