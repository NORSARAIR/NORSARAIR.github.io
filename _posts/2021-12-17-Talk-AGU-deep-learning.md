We will be giving an invited talk at the AGU 2021 during the session S51A - Geophysical and Planetary Seismoacoustics: Capturing the Full Wavefield <https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/883443>. I will be discussing the implementation of a deep learning technique trained over a synthetic dataset to predict ground transmission loss, i.e., attenuation of infrasound waves vs range from a surface source.
