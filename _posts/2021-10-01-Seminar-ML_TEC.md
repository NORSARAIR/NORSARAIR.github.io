I will be giving a seminar together with Elvira Astafyeva at JPL, in the ionospheric group led by Olga Verkhoglyadova <https://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/people/o_verkhoglyadova> in October 2021. Results from my recent submitted paper on automatic detection of co-seismic ionospheric disturbances will be discussed.
