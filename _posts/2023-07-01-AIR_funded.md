We are excited to open the website for our project AIR! In the next 3 years we will assess the feasibility of exploring Venus' interior using balloons. This effort was funded by the Research Council of Norway. The project is owned by <a href="https://norsar.no" style="text-decoration: underline">NORSAR</a>.
