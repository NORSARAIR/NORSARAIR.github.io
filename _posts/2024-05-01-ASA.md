Our team was **invited to present our project AIR and our recent inversion results at the annual meeting of the Acoustic Society of America (ASA)**. Our work was highlighted by the conference organizers <a href="https://acoustics.org/listen-in-infrasonic-whispers-reveal-the-hidden-structure-of-planetary-interiors-and-atmospheres/" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a>.

In this presentation, **we presented a review of infrasound-based inversion results including atmospheric and subsurface inversions**. We also discussed existing challenges for infrasound-based planetary science and the most recent results of the AIR project. You can find our presentation below:
