AIR participated to the **Venus seismology workshop at the International Space Science Institute (ISSI)** in January 2024 (<a href="https://teams.issibern.ch/seismicityonvenus/" style="text-decoration: underline">[https://teams.issibern.ch/seismicityonvenus/](https://teams.issibern.ch/seismicityonvenus/)</a>). Peter Nasholm and Celine Marie Solberg attended the workshop and presented our AIR project and recent results on venusquake detectability. The goal of this workshop was to push the enveloppe for Venus seismology. **Multiple studies will come out of this workshop including work on detectability, seismicity, and estimates on seismogenic thickness**.
