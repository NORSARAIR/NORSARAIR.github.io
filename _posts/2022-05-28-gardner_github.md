I just released a Python implementation of Gardner's model to generate atmospheric gravity-wave perturbations: <https://github.com/QuentinBrissaud/gardner_perturbations>. This code has been employed in my recent work for transmission-loss modeling using deep learning: [See blog post]({% post_url 2021-09-28-ML_acoustic %})
