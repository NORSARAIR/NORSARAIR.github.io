I will be giving an invited talk in the Digital Processing Group of the University of Oslo <https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/dsb/index.html> on Tuesday, March 22. I will be discussing the implementation of a deep learning technique trained over a synthetic dataset to predict ground transmission loss, i.e., attenuation of infrasound waves vs range from a surface source.
