Our team was **invited to present our project AIR and our recent inversion results at the Internoise conference** (<a href="https://internoise2024.org/" style="text-decoration: underline">https://internoise2024.org/</a>). This conference is primiraly focusing on engineering problems using acoustic data. However, this year, an infrasound session was organized and we were invited by the conveners to discuss more exotic applications of acoustic analyses.

<br>

**In this presentation, we did a thorough review of recent works on infrasound-based planetary science**. Our slides can be found below. Together with our presentation, we wrote a conference proceeding describing recent advances in more details {% cite froment2024probing %}.
