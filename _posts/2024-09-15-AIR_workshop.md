AIR organized its **first workshop fully dedicated to Venus seismology**. The goal of this workshop is to bring the Venus science, seismology, and infrasound communities together to discuss ongoing challenges, new scientific results, and potential opportunities to prepare the next round of planetary missions. **The workshop took place on September 16 and Friday 20, 2024**.

<br>

**More than 30 scientists attended the workshop** spaned over two sessions of 3h over two days. **Each session will consist of research presentations, including seismology and acoustics, geodynamical simulations, and new balloon-borne observations, and interactive sessions**. During the interactive sessions, we will attempt to provide solutions to address specific research questions (and potentially raise new concerns) and pave the way for future collaborations.
