The AIR project ultimate goal is to build an efficient framework to map seismic infrasound to subsurface velocity structures on Venus. However, our abaility to invert infrasound data will very much depend on our ability to detect these signals in a first place. But, **can we really detect seismic infrasound from a balloon platform on Venus?** Recent balloon experiements on Earth seem to confirm that large or close-by events can, indeed, be detected {% cite nasholm2024exploring %}.
