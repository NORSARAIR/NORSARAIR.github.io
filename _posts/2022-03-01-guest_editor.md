For the first time, the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America (<https://www.seismosoc.org/publications/bssa/>) will release a special issue on seismo-acoustic in 2022. I will be a guest editor of this special issue until the end of 2023 together with the great Fransiska Dannemann, Alex Lezi, Jelle Assink, Jordan Bishop, and Leo Martire. Updates coming soon...
